## 2. Current repository boundary

Active continuation: `codex/sde-history-prefix-route-closure`.

Active PR: `#157 — SDE correctness repair: close CR-A CR-B CR-C`.

The PR title is historical relative to the branch contents. It now carries the accepted continuation through C4 and IF-D. Keep it **Draft**. Do not mark ready, merge, rebase, force-push or resolve the main conflict unless explicitly authorized.

Live `main` contains the later merged M8G5 Mini MCP workflow/control-plane commit that is not on the continuation, so #157 remains divergent / dirty against main. This is an integration gate, not a reason to interrupt RH-E.

Repository cleanup before RH-E:

- validation-only/superseded PRs #148, #154, #156, #158, #160 and #161 are closed without merge;
- diagnostic PR #109 is closed as obsolete for the current short-horizon Recovery contract after a fresh current-format atomicity audit;
- temporary validation remote branches from the first cleanup wave are gone;
- remaining historical branch pruning is hygiene only and must preserve unique archive material.

Always query live Git/PR state before executable work. Do not rely on a hard-coded live branch HEAD in this document.

## 3. Accepted executable checkpoints

These are historical acceptance identities, not current branch heads:

| Checkpoint | Accepted evidence |
| --- | --- |
| CR-A/B/C | validation head `4245ddb8c12782775a6b4c237f5dd7f0f1ce92c0`; CI #3459 + R2 #3212 GREEN |
| C4 / SDE-3D2 | formal `21206a8ca95896ffad83eaba5695a3a571c6cd74`, tree `a4701e0f4873ddd629dfa11163a94d2aa0cb9b8b`; exact-tree CI #3473 + R2 #3226 GREEN |
| IF-D | formal `4d1b6d7f39529402eb9ec1e6032eb80ef9a14e86`, tree `181a1d80d449c2d443a678e10033acda13c777d1`; exact-tree CI #3476 + R2 #3229 GREEN |
| RH-E | formal `f51a295983e8e203119dd50693af343c1ec23906`, tree `2babb1fba00b46dfc676efb6f090386b7a73826f`; validation-only PR #162 head `bf66363385420f507f92a729b496ff002791dee5`; exact-tree CI #3478 + R2 #3231 GREEN |

Later documentation-only changes must not be re-labelled as validating a different executable tree.

## 4. Current priority — #157 versus live-main integration audit

RH-E is COMPLETE. The accepted runtime diagnostic contract now has one process-scoped serialized background persistence lane, ordered append/correlation semantics, stale/cancellation protection, bounded retention, and separate evaluation / queue / persistence / total timing. Canonical session state remains authoritative and independent of diagnostic durability.

The next executable action is a fresh integration audit of Draft PR #157 against live `main`.

That audit must:

- refresh live `main`, #157 exact head/state/draft/mergeability and remote checks;
- classify the actual conflict/divergence introduced by the later M8G5 workflow/control-plane merge;
- distinguish mechanical integration conflicts from semantic/product conflicts;
- propose the smallest safe integration route and required acceptance evidence;
- preserve the accepted RH-E executable tree and all later documentation-only records.

The audit is read-only with respect to integration. Do **not** rebase, resolve conflicts, mark #157 ready, merge or force-push without explicit user authorization.

## 5. Recovery product boundary

Recent Emergency Recovery is intentionally **short-horizon emergency continuation**, not a normal save-game product.

Current validity contract:

~~~text
current RecoverySnapshot format
+ exact current compatibility token
+ <= 4 hour age
-> validated current recovery plan
~~~

Do not add cross-version migration, old-format reconstruction, tolerant legacy repair or long-term save compatibility unless the product requirement changes explicitly.

PR #109 reproduced an old/abnormal event/observation half-state. Current production does not expose a physical persistence window for that intermediate state: the game event and semantic projection execute synchronously before later SideEffect/lifecycle Recovery persistence. #109 was therefore closed rather than converted into legacy compatibility code.

If a future **current-version** crash produces a fresh inconsistent current-format Recovery snapshot, treat it as a new current-format atomicity defect with new evidence.

## 6. Frozen architecture / policy decisions

- `BEGINNER_CONSERVATIVE_V1` remains immutable.
- No placeholder V2.
- No numeric weights/thresholds without the evidence level required by the affected policy semantics.
- Legal candidate ownership remains in rules/domain owners; SDE ranks only legal alternatives.
- Canonical session/history owners remain the only mutable game truth.
- DecisionTrace/replay/export are read-only diagnostic/calibration projections.
- Red Herring legality/commit ownership is not moved into SDE policy.
- Drunk/Poisoned information may be true or false; impaired narrative uses the accepted shared perceived-functioning projection.
- Spy/Recluse registration remains interaction-scoped.
- Demon bluffs remain a joint SDE output until committed.
- No fixture-specific or named-player policy branches.
- Traveller evidence remains outside the current mainline algorithm unless explicitly brought into scope.

## 7. Evidence track

ClocktowerEvidenceLab continues independently and does not block RH-E.

Evidence stages remain:

- E1 — architecture/lifecycle evidence;
- E2 — semantic regression evidence;
- E3 — qualitative policy evidence strong enough to justify a typed preference/reason;
- E4 — quantitative calibration evidence when a policy genuinely requires numeric strength.

Observed expert choices without adequate rationale are not automatically policy labels. Complete real games and expert Storyteller rationale remain preferred over synthetic clean-corpus calibration.

C5 remains blocked until a genuinely qualifying E3/E4 predicate exists.

## 8. Immediate execution order

~~~text
refresh live main + #157 exact state
-> audit #157 versus live-main divergence/conflicts
-> classify integration-only versus semantic conflicts
-> propose guarded integration + acceptance route
-> wait for explicit authorization before any rebase/conflict resolution/ready/merge
~~~

RH-E implementation and remote acceptance are complete; do not reopen it unless new current-version evidence exposes a regression.

## 9. Current authorities

Read first:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW_CURRENT_2026-09-27.md`
3. `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
4. this roadmap
5. `docs/NEXT_DEVELOPMENT_HANDOFF.md`
6. `docs/SDE_POST_AUDIT_CORRECTNESS_REPAIR_ROUTE_2026-09-25.md` — RH-E contract and completed repair record
7. `docs/SDE_3D2_TRUTH_CREDIBILITY_RED_HERRING_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_2026-09-26.md` — completed C4 architecture/evidence boundary
8. `docs/SDE_3D0_CALIBRATED_POLICY_FREEZE_CUTOVER_GATE_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_2026-09-24.md` — freeze/cutover gates

Use older SDE-3A/B/C/C0–C3 completion documents only when a specific historical or ownership question requires them.

## 10. Testing cadence

Follow `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`.

RH-E completed at T4 with exact-tree CI #3478 and R2 #3231 GREEN, including Android FULL + assemble, ASP contracts and Real Clingo cross-validation.

GitHub CI/R2 remains the normal Android execution and independent remote acceptance surface. The N3150 execution-host experiment remains retired from the default workflow unless the user explicitly reopens it.

A documentation-only compaction does not require Android regression by itself.
